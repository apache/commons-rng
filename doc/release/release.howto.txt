This document is meant as a step-by-step recipe to achieve the release of
the Commons RNG component. Note that more general instructions valid
for all components, including [rng], are available on the Apache Commons
main site: at "https://commons.apache.org/releases/prepare.html" and
"https://commons.apache.org/releases/release.html".

When performing a release it is recommended to make notes of any changes that
were required to those detailed in this document. The changes can be incorporated
after a successful release.

The files "settings-security.xml" and "settings.xml" are minimal examples
of files used by maven to pick up authentication credentials needed to
connect to remote servers and to cryptographically sign the artifacts.

Release preparation is done on the release manager local host in a branch.
As branches deletion is now forbidden at Apache, we will use a specific
release branch for every version.
The branch will be simply named X.Y-release, with X.Y being the version number.
The branch will be used to store the release specific parts (i.e. the pom changes with
the version number, the release date in the site and so on). Everything else and in
particular code change that will remain in the component after the release must be
committed to the master branch (or version branch). The release candidate branch will
be created from master or version branch at the start of each new candidate for
this particular release. Once the release is done, the branch will be merged back to
master, but it will never be deleted so release history will be preserved.

The example below show a typical workflow. Just after commit A in the master branch, the
X.Y-release branch is created starting from master. This is shown by the 'b' in the
second line. Then release specific commits are made on the pom and a few other
files, leading to a commit which will be tagged as RC1. This release candidate fails, and
a few corrections need to be made on master, corresponding to commits B and C. Then the
X.Y-release branch is synchronized by running a 'git merge' command on the branch.
This is shown by the 'm' in the second line. A new commit is tagged as RC2. This second
release candidate also fails, and a new correction is made on master branch, a new merge
is done on the X.Y-release branch, a new commit is tagged and a third release candidate is
create, which succeeds. Then a final tag will be added on the final commit of this branch
showing the status as released. Then the files are cleaned to prepare for next version
(pom getting again a SNAPSHOT suffix, changes.xml getting a new placeholder for changes)
and the cleaned branch is merged back to master. Once the X.Y-release branch has been merged,
it is kept for history. The release for next version will use another specific branch.


 ----A-------> B --> C----------> D--------------------------------------m---->    <- master branch
      \               \            \                                    /
       b---> RC1 ------m---> RC2 ---m---> RC3/final release --> cleaning --X       <- X.Y-release branch

This process allows:

 - to never commit release candidate specific changes to the master
   branch (so the pom on master always holds a SNAPSHOT version),
 - to preserve future reference to the release
 - to allow parallel work on master during the release
 - if necessary to have multiple release managers or help on the
   release as the X.Y-release branch is shared

NOTE
----

When performing a release it is good practice to edit a copy of these notes during the process
and merge the updated document into the repository following a release. To assist in this process
a find-and-replace can be performed to update all the version numbers in order. For example
based on a previous release of 1.5:

- Next development version  : 1.6 -> 1.7
- Next release version      : 1.5 -> 1.6
- Previous release version  : 1.4 -> 1.5
- Release candidate version : RC1 -> RC2   (if applicable)

This allows the included commands to be coped during the release process.


(0)
Preliminary checks:
 * All Java files must contain a license header. The "RAT" maven plugin will
   generate a report indicating for which files the license is missing.
 * For a "minor" release, the library must be backward-compatible.
   Ensure the binary compatibility release version is correctly set in the pom.xml using the
   appropriate properties:
     <properties>
       <!-- ... -->
       <!-- upcoming release version -->
       <commons.release.version>1.5</commons.release.version>
       <!-- previous release version -->
       <commons.bc.version>1.4</commons.bc.version>
       <!-- ... -->
     </properties>
   Check all the issues reported by the "japicmp" plugin.
   Check the new public/protected API classes/interfaces/methods/enums have an appropriate
   @since tag for the release.
 * Clear all "CheckStyle" warnings.
 * Make sure that the construct reported by "SpotBugs" and "PMD" are intentional.
 * Mark all issues fixed in the release as resolved in the bug-tracking system (JIRA). Issues marked
   as 'Implemented' or 'Fixed' will appear in the changes report. Add a corresponding entry in
   "src/changes/changes.xml" for the JIRA ticket. To search for unresolved tickets
   click 'Releases' on the left menu and select the upcoming release version.


(1)
As an optional step, you can test that everything works locally, i.e.
that the build process can create all the necessary artifacts.

  (1a)
  The command

    $ JAVA_HOME="__Path_to_a_JDK__" mvn -Duser.name="__Your_Apache_id__" -Ptest-deploy -Prelease clean verify site deploy [-Dgpg.skip]

  should create the artifacts in the "target/deploy" directory. The site goal
  is required for the commons release plugin even though the site is
  built separately for the full multi-module project to include the examples.

  The "dist-archive/target" directory will contain those files:

    commons-rng-1.5-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz
    commons-rng-1.5-SNAPSHOT-bin.zip
    commons-rng-1.5-SNAPSHOT-src.tar.gz
    commons-rng-1.5-SNAPSHOT-src.zip

  At some point when processing the above command, the GPG passphrase will be
  requested; to avoid problems, the "gpg2" executable should be specified in
  the "settings.xml" file (see below).
  Note: If running from a remote terminal, you might need to tune the "gpg-agent"
  configuration file
    ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
  to contain the following statements:
    ---CUT---
    enable-ssh-support
    pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-tty
    ---CUT---
  and execute
    $ export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
  in order to set up the environment for entering the passphrase.

  For testing, or when GPG is not configured, this can be avoided using "-Dgpg.skip" argument
  in the maven release dry run command.

  (1b)
  The command (requires Java 11):

    $ JAVA_HOME="__Path_to_a_JDK__" mvn -Pexamples package site site:stage

  should create the site in the "target/staging" directory. The JPMS example modules require
  Java 11.

  Note: The examples are not part of the binary distribution (release profile) but are
  included in the site for documentation.


(2)
At this point, you will work mainly on the X.Y-release branch.

If the X.Y-release branch does not exist because it is the first release
candidate, create it locally starting from the master branch or the version
branch and push it to Apache repository (assuming it is called origin),
remembering the binding between the local and remote origin branches:

  $ git branch 1.5-release
  $ git push -u origin 1.5-release

(Optional)
Modify the dist-archive/pom.xml to update the release manager name and GPG signing key
to be used for the release.


(3)
Switch to the release branch:

  $ git checkout 1.5-release


(4)
If there have been changes committed in the master branch or the version
branch since the creation of the release branch, there are two cases:

  (4a)
  if all these changes must be included in version 1.5, merge "master"
  or the version branch into "1.5-release":

    $ git merge master

  or, if the version branch is called "RNG_1_X"

    $ git merge RNG_1_X

  (4b)
  if only part of these changes must be included in version 1.5,
  cherry-pick the required commits into the "1.5-release" branch:

    $ git cherry-pick commit-SHA


(5)
Update the release specific files, checking you are really working on the
1.5-release branch and *not* on the master branch.

In particular:
 * Update and commit the "src/site/site.xml" file to contain the information
   about the API docs of the new release. This is for each of
   common-rng-<module> with <module>: client-api; core; sampling; and simple.
 * Estimate a release date (taking into account the release vote delay) and
   insert it in the "src/changes/changes.xml" file.
 * Update the "pom.xml" to contain the final version number and not a SNAPSHOT:
   Assuming that the release version will be "1.5", modify the "<version>" tag to
   read:

    <version>1.5</version>

   This can be done using maven:

    $ mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.5 -DgenerateBackupPoms=false

   Modify the section of "<properties>" that also refers to version numbers.
   You should uncomment the "<commons.rc.version>" line and indicate the
   appropriate numbering of the release candidate: This refers to how many
   times you will need to repeat this whole release process until it is
   accepted (by a vote):

  <properties>
    <!-- ... -->
    <commons.release.version>1.5</commons.release.version>
    <commons.rc.version>RC1</commons.rc.version>
    <!-- ... -->
  </properties>

   Other known locations of the project version:

   commons-rng-bom/src/site/xdoc/index.xml


(6)
The "download" page template is located at "src/site/xdoc/download_rng.xml".
This file is updated automatically by running the command:

  $ mvn -N -Pexamples commons-build:download-page

  Note: This command presently requires Java 8.

(7)
The "release notes" file will be created by gathering all the changes
collected during development in the file "src/changes/changes.xml".

Create it by running:

  $ mvn -Prelease-notes -Pexamples changes:announcement-generate

Ensure the formatting of the RELEASE-NOTES.txt is consistent. Compare the main
header description to the previous release notes in src/site/resources/release-notes/
and update the line wrap formatting to match. Remove trailing whitespace.
Ensure the lines wrap at 100 characters.
Note that wrapping is taken from changes.xml which should be written to wrap
at 100 characters but allowing for a indent on the first line due to the RNG
issue field. Update changes.xml if appropriate.

Append the previous release notes from src/site/resources/release-notes/ to the current one:

  $ (echo "=============================================================================" &&
     cat src/site/resources/release-notes/RELEASE-NOTES-1.4.txt) >> RELEASE-NOTES.txt

Copy the RELEASE-NOTES.txt to src/site/resources/release-notes:

  $ cp RELEASE-NOTES.txt src/site/resources/release-notes/RELEASE-NOTES-1.5.txt

Update the src/site/xdoc/release-history.xml to include the latest version. This generates
the release history page on the web site.

Commit the updated files to git:

  $ git add */src/site/site.xml \
            src/changes/changes.xml \
            pom.xml \
            src/site/xdoc/download_rng.xml \
            RELEASE-NOTES.txt \
            src/site/resources/release-notes/RELEASE-NOTES-* \
            src/site/xdoc/release-history.xml \
            commons-rng-bom/src/site/xdoc/index.xml

Check you did not forget any files:

  $ git status

Commit the changes:

  $ git commit -m "Release candidate."


(8)
Create a GPG signed tag that will contain the whole source of this release candidate.
First, make sure once again that the workspace is up-to-date:

  $ git status

Then, assuming the first candidate, the suffix will be "RC1" (this should
be the same as in the "<properties>" in the "pom.xml"), and the command
will be:

  $ git tag -u "__Your_key_id__" -s -m "RC1." commons-rng-1.5-RC1

If you have several GPG keys, you may prefer to use "-u keyId" to select a specific
key for signing the tag instead of "-s" which select automatically one key
from the configured e-mail address.

Check the tag GPG signature:

  $ git tag -v commons-rng-1.5-RC1

You will get something like:

  object cf4a9d70c9ac24dd7196995390171150e4e56451
  type commit
  tag commons-rng-1.5-RC1
  tagger YourName <YourApacheEmail> 1418934614 +0100

  RC1.

followed by GPG output lines.

Remember the commit ID listed in the object line (here cf4a9d70c9ac24dd7196995390171150e4e56451),
as it is the most stable reference for traceability.

Push everything (including the tag!) on the Apache repository:

  $ git push && git push origin commons-rng-1.5-RC1


(9)
Switch to a new directory out of your regular workspace, and retrieve
the official tag from the Apache repository:

  $ cd /tmp
  $ git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/commons-rng.git --branch commons-rng-1.5-RC1

In the command above, the --branch option accepts both branch names and tags names,
so we specify directly the tag here. Git will warn that the resulting workspace
is in 'detached HEAD' state and 'git status' commands will warn that you are not
currently on any branch. This is expected in this situation.

Check that the last commit has the id you noted in the previous step:

  $ cd commons-rng
  $ git log -1


(10)
If this is your first release, you might need to add your GPG encryption
key to the KEYS file. [If you have already done so, skip this section.]

Retrieve the files from the SVN repository:

  $ svn co --depth=files \
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/commons/svn

and follow the instructions at the top of the "KEYS" file.


(11)
Create and transfer the artifacts to the Nexus server (a.k.a. "deploy").

Because the artifacts must be cryptographically signed, this step requires that
a profile named "release" exists in the maven "settings.xml" configuration file
which will contain the identifier of your GPG key (cf. sample "settings.xml"
file). You will also have to follow the instructions at
https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html to set your password
for your apache id in the settings.xml file which is used for Nexus repository staging.

The release process requires commit access for the commons SVN repository used to host the
web site. This will use the provided 'user.name' for SVN. If your SVN is not set-up to
cache passwords then a password must be provided. This can be done using a <server> section in
the maven settings.xml file. Typically the username is the same for Nexus repository staging
(i.e. your apache id) so the server 'apache.releases.https' configured in the example
settings.xml file can be used by setting the commons.distServer property for the commons release
plugin (see https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-release-plugin/index.html).

You can then generate the release artifacts without the site generation:

  $ mvn -Duser.name="__Your_Apache_id__" [-Dcommons.distServer=apache.releases.https] \
        [-Duser.password=<yourApacheIdsPassword] \
        -Prelease clean package site deploy

which will transfer the artifacts to the Nexus repository located at
  https://repository.apache.org/index.html#stagingRepositories

The apache ID password is required to clean and deploy the binary distribution
files to svn if the svn client is not configured to locally cache the user
password.

Note: The 'site' goal is required for the release plugin. The live site
should be generated separately to include the examples modules for
documentation. The release profile will not include the example modules as they
are not part of the binary release artifacts. The 'package' goal is required
to generate a jar file for the japicmp report.

Using Java 8 ensures a package-list is created for the javadoc in each module. Later Java
versions may generate an element-list. If the site is generated including the examples
module using JDK 11+ without running 'mvn clean' then the package-list will coexist
alongside the newly generated element-list. This allows the javadocs to be searchable
from new and old JDKs.

This process transfers more files than really needed in the the "staging" (i.e.
non official) maven repository. The files expected in the repository for jar
artifacts are
  commons-rng-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.5.pom
  commons-rng-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.5.jar
  commons-rng-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.5.javadoc.jar
  commons-rng-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.5.sources.jar
  commons-rng-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.5.test-sources.jar
  commons-rng-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.5.tests.jar
  commons-rng-<ModuleArtifactID>-1.5.spdx.rdf.xml
and their associated fingerprints
  <file-name>.md5
  <file-name>.sha1
and their signatures
  <file-name>.asc

The commons-rng-parent and commons-rng-bom artifact should contain the pom
and the associated fingerprints and signatures. The commons-parent also
contains a Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) file.

Nexus used to add "md5" and "sha1" checksums files to the "asc" files
(cryptographic signature). If these fingerprints on signatures are
present, they must be manually removed from Nexus staging area.

***
Note: The commons-rng-bom artifact is deployed using the sign-and-deploy goal
of the maven gpg plugin. This still adds md5 and sha1 files for the artifact asc
files and these should be deleted.

Select each .asc.md5 and .asc.sha1 file and delete the artifact. Then refresh
the view and confirm the deletion.
***

The process used to transfer the complete source and binaries distributions files,
(for each module):
  commons-rng-<ModuleArtifactId>-1.5-bin.tar.gz
  commons-rng-<ModuleArtifactId>-1.5-bin.zip
  commons-rng-<ModuleArtifactId>-1.5-src.tar.gz
  commons-rng-<ModuleArtifactId>-1.5-src.zip
as well as their associated .md5 and .sha1 fingerprints and .asc signatures.
All these files are not maven artifacts but rather distribution archives: They
belong elsewhere; hence they must also been removed from the Nexus staging
repository.

As a final validity check, the Nexus repository must be manually "closed"
before other people review the deliverables just created.
How to "close" the staging repository is explained at this page:
  http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#close-stage

The nexus staging ID should be noted so that it can be used in the generation
of the VOTE email. The id is the XXXX number from the repository id with the
format orgapachecommons-XXXX.

(12)
[NOTE: The "Commons release-plugin" now automatically performs all the tasks
referred to in this section.]

***
Verify that the release plugin has performed the steps below.
You may be required to remove the staged site from the "dev" area
and add missing files. The following was performed for release 1.5:

  $ cd /tmp
  $ svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/commons/rng
  $ cd rng/1.5-RC1
  $ svn del site
  $ svn commit -m "Distribution files for Commons RNG v1.5 (RC1)."
***

Create and upload the other distribution files to the Apache servers.

  (12a)
  Perform a server-side copy of the README.html from the "release" area of
  the Apache dist server to the "dev" area:

    $ svn cp https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/commons/rng/README.html \
             https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/commons/rng/README.html

  (12b)
  The modules "dist-archive" dedicated to creating the archive files.
  Run the following command:

    $ ( cd dist-archive && mvn -P release assembly:single )

  (12c)
  Go to a temporary directory and check out the "dev" area.

    $ cd /tmp
    $ svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/commons/rng
    $ cd rng

  (12d)
  Edit the "README.html" file to contain the released version number.

  (12e)
  Copy other files from the RC workspace:

    $ cp path-to-the-RC-workspace/RELEASE-NOTES.txt .
    $ cp path-to-the-RC-workspace/dist-archive/target/commons-release-plugin/scm/1.5-RC1/README.html .
    $ cp path-to-the-RC-workspace/dist-archive/target/*-bin.* binaries
    $ cp path-to-the-RC-workspace/dist-archive/target/*-src.* source

  Currently, the commons-parent build does not create the
   * signatures (".asc"),
   * checksums (".md5"),
   * hashes (".sha1")
  of the distribution files.  Hence, you have to create them "manually"!
  For the signature, the command would be
    $ gpg -ab file-to-sign
  For the hash, the commands is
    $ sha512sum -b input-file > input-file.sha512

  Double-check the signatures and hashes with the following:
    $ gpg --verify asc-file
    $ sha512sum -c hash-file

  (12f)
  Commit to SVN:

    $ svn add \
      README.html \
      RELEASE-NOTES.txt \
      binaries/* \
      source/*
    $ svn commit -m "Distribution files for Commons RNG v1.5 (RC1)."


(13)
[NOTE: The "Commons release-plugin" now automatically uploads the web site
to the "dist dev" area of the svn repository.  However, for multi-module
maven projects, the site is incomplete.]

As the web site staging area is shared among all commons components and therefore
could be published before the vote ends, it is not recommended to use the standard
staging area for the release candidate. So you will just archive the site and
transfer it to your apache personal area for review.
Here is how to do this using "lftp" to initiate the sftp transfer. "lftp" supports
a mirror command for recursive transfers; don't forget the -R flag for uploading
instead of downloading the site.
If you haven't setup your login on home.apache.org you will need to go to
  https://id.apache.org/
login and copy the contents of your
  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
file to "SSH Key (authorized_keys line)".
Then run these commands:

  Note: Site generation requires Java 11 for the examples JPMS modules.
  With site generation the 'package' goal is required for the site report javadoc
  of the Java 11 JPMS modules and for japicmp.

  Do not run 'clean' as it will delete the release source/binary artifacts and the
  release plugin cannot be used to generate the template VOTE.txt file with the
  correct hashes. It also removes the previous javadocs package-list generated using
  Java 8.

  $ mvn -Pexamples package site site:stage

  $ cd target
  $ mv staging commons-rng-1.5-RC1-site
  $ lftp sftp://__Your_apache_login__@home.apache.org
     lftp you@home.apache.org:~> mkdir public_html
     lftp you@home.apache.org:~> cd public_html
     lftp you@home.apache.org:~/public_html> mirror -R commons-rng-1.5-RC1-site
     lftp you@home.apache.org:~/public_html> bye

If lftp fails with 'Fatal error: Host key verification failed.' then the host
key for home.apache.org may have changed. Try to ssh to the server. This will be
refused as only ftp connections are allowed but the error message should
describe how to update the SSH known hosts to remove the error.

(14)
[NOTE: The "Commons release-plugin" can generate the text for the "[VOTE]"
message. However, the script makes some (incorrect) assumptions and produces
a result that must be heavily edited.]

Template the vote using this command (run from the dist-archive module):

  $ mvn org.apache.commons:commons-release-plugin:vote-txt \
        -Dgit.tag.commit=commons-rng-1.5-RC1 \
        -Dcommons.nexus.repo.id=XXXX

where XXXX is the nexus repository staging ID. The output is target/VOTE.txt.
This must be heavily edited. It is useful to generate the release hashes.

Call to vote by sending a message to the "dev" ML with subject
"[VOTE][RC1] Release Commons RNG 1.5". You can use the following example as
a reference point, replacing the URLs with the appropriate ones:
----------
We have fixed quite a few bugs and added some significant enhancements since Apache Commons RNG 1.4 was released, so I would like to release Apache Commons RNG 1.5.

Apache Commons RNG 1.5 RC1 is available for review here:
    https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/commons/rng/1.5-RC1 (svn revision 49724)

The Git tag commit for this RC is commons-rng-1.5-RC1 which you can browse here:
    https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=commons-rng.git;a=commit;h=commons-rng-1.5-RC1

You may checkout this tag using:
    git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/commons-rng.git --branch commons-rng-1.5-RC1 commons-rng-1.5-RC1
(signature can be checked from git using 'git tag -v commons-rng-1.5-RC1')

Commit ID the tag points at:
    6f2e939bc1ae5d7c1317d4fb1af9ef3ac8d45e54

Maven artifacts are here:
    https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachecommons-XXXX/org/apache/commons/

These are the artifacts and their hashes:

#Release SHA-512s
#[Date]
commons-rng-1.5-src.zip=<hash>
commons-rng-1.5-src.tar.gz=<hash>
commons-rng-1.5-bin.tar.gz=<hash>
commons-rng-1.5-bin.zip=<hash>

Signatures may be validated on a system supporting a bash Unix shell by executing:
    svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/commons/rng/1.5-RC1/
    cd 1.5-RC1
    chmod +x ./signature-validator.sh
    for m in client-api core simple sampling bom; do ./signature-validator.sh https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/orgapachecommons-1596/org/apache/commons/commons-rng-${m}/1.5/; done

The source code contains examples that are not part of the public API. These examples contain Java 11 modules and are enabled using a profile (see below).

Note: Testing randomness using statistical thresholds results in failures at a given probability. The 'maven-surefire-plugin' is configured to re-run tests that fail, and pass the build if they succeed within the allotted number of reruns (the test will be marked as 'flaky' in the report).

I have tested this with 'mvn clean install' using:

Apache Maven 3.6.3 (cecedd343002696d0abb50b32b541b8a6ba2883f)
Maven home: /usr/local/apache-maven-3.6.3

Default locale: en_GB, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "4.15.0-153-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"

I have tested this with 'mvn clean package site site:stage -Pexamples' using:

(15)
If some blocking problems have been found in the release deliverables, cancel
the vote by sending a "[CANCEL][VOTE]" message to the "dev" ML.
After correcting the problems, you'll likely have to start again from step 3,
4 or 5.


(16)
After at least 72 hours have elapsed, send a "[VOTE][RESULT]" mail to
summarize the outcome of the vote. This should tally the votes cast,
and state which are binding (PMC members). The vote needs at least three +1's
from PMC members to pass.


(17)
The distribution files must be moved from the development area to the release
area of the Apache dist server.

  (17a)
  Checkout the official distribution repository:

    $ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/commons/rng

  Identify symbolic links:

    $ find rng -type l

  (17b)
  Copy the files from the checkout of the repository that was voted on:

    $ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/commons/rng rng2
    $ cd rng2
    $ rsync -Cav ../rng/1.5-RC1/ .

  [Note: This might overwrite symbolic links; in this case, do a "svn
  revert" in order to restore the files that should not be updated.]

    $ svn revert binaries/HEADER.html binaries/README.html \
                 source/HEADER.html source/README.html

  (17c)
  Check files. The following is useful:

    $ svn diff --summarize

  Perform a "svn add" for the new release artifacts.
  Perform a "svn del" for the old release(s) artifacts.

    $ svn add binaries/*-1.5-* source/*-1.5-*
    $ svn del binaries/*-1.4-* source/*-1.4-*

  (17d)
  Commit:

    $ svn commit -m "Release Commons RNG v1.5 (from RC1)."

  (17e)
  Register the release at
    https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?commons


(18)
Login to the Nexus repository located at
  https://repository.apache.org/index.html#stagingRepositories

Release (a.k.a. "promote") the artifacts on the Nexus server, as shown here:
  http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#promote


(19)
Publish the web site. This is done by first committing the web site to the
staging area, and then by publishing the staging area (which is shared among
all commons components).

To assist in committing the web site to the staging area, a profile can be used
to checkout the current site to the folder 'site-content'. However this does not perform a
complete checkout and the directory must be updated:

 $ mvn -Psite-checkout -N pre-site
 $ (cd site-content && svn up --set-depth infinity)

Note that svn commits in the site-content directory are immediately synced with
the live site and so your changes should show up in a few minutes once you
commit the new site. You can also check out the site directly by yourself
elsewhere:

  $ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/commons/content/proper/commons-rng site-content

Remove all files there (except .svn folder) and move all the files from the site.

 $ cd site-content
 $ rm -rf *
 $ cp -pR ../target/commons-rng-1.5-RC1-site/* .

Check for new or deleted files:
 $ svn status
and "svn add" or "svn del" them if necessary.

It is very useful to know changes to the project since the last release. The
japicmp report is helpful for the public API. Changes in commons-rng-examples
are not subject to these reports and require developer insight. If in doubt do
not delete files.

Note the svn symbols (svn status --help):

M - Modified (will be committed)
A - Marked for addition
D - Marked for deletion
? - Not under version control (must be marked as A to add)
! - Missing (must be marked as D to remove)

The following commands are useful.

Note that the "awk '{if ... print $2}'" only works for files that have no
spaces. Currently the only files known to have spaces are the SPDX files,
e.g. 'Apache Commons RNG-1.5.spdx.rdf.xml'; these must be committed manually.

Reverting (may not be required):

  $ svn status | grep ^M | less
  $ svn status | awk '{if ($1 == "M") print $2 }' | xargs svn revert

Deleting (**do not** delete old javadocs):

  $ svn status | grep -v javadocs | grep ^! | less
  $ svn status | grep -v javadocs | awk '{if ($1 == "!") print $2 }' | xargs svn del

Adding:

  $ svn status | grep ^? | less
  $ svn status | awk '{if ($1 == "?") print $2 }' | xargs svn add

Check the local website:

  $ open index.html

Commit the new contents of the web site:
  $ svn commit -m "Commons RNG v1.5 was released (from RC1). Web site update"

Note the SVN website revision for the next step (javadocs archiving).


Edit the file component_releases.properties to hold the current version and release date for
your component:

  $ svn checkout --depth files https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/cms-site/trunk/conf/

  [edit file: conf/component_releases.properties]

  $ (cd conf && svn commit -m "Commons RNG v1.5 was released (from RC1)")


(20)
The Javadoc for several versions is kept available on the website, under the
"javadocs" directory.
There is a huge number of files that never change, so they are not retrieved by
default in the working copy when running 'svn checkout'.
The Javadoc must therefore be copied manually using server side copy from the
"apidocs" directory after release, in order for the links to former versions
to work. This is done as follows:

  $ export RNG_WEB_SITE_SVN_REVISION=1002658
  $ export RNG_RELEASE_VERSION=1.5
  $ svnmucc -U https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/commons/content/proper/commons-rng \
      cp $RNG_WEB_SITE_SVN_REVISION commons-rng-client-api/apidocs \
                                    commons-rng-client-api/javadocs/api-$RNG_RELEASE_VERSION \
      cp $RNG_WEB_SITE_SVN_REVISION commons-rng-core/apidocs \
                                    commons-rng-core/javadocs/api-$RNG_RELEASE_VERSION \
      cp $RNG_WEB_SITE_SVN_REVISION commons-rng-simple/apidocs \
                                    commons-rng-simple/javadocs/api-$RNG_RELEASE_VERSION \
      cp $RNG_WEB_SITE_SVN_REVISION commons-rng-sampling/apidocs \
                                    commons-rng-sampling/javadocs/api-$RNG_RELEASE_VERSION \
      -m "Commons RNG: Copying $RNG_RELEASE_VERSION apidocs to versioned directories for the long-term links."

[Note: The script "doc/release/copyLongTermJavadoc.sh" performs the above
command (options are the svn revision and the component's new version).]

  $ doc/release/copyLongTermJavadoc.sh -r 1080991 -v 1.5

Wait a few minutes for the live site to fully sync and then check
  https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-rng/
to make sure that everything looks correct.


(21)
Edit "doap_rng.rdf" to add the just released version date.
It is located at
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/cms-site/trunk/doap
in the SVN repository.

  $ svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/cms-site/trunk/doap

  [edit file: doap/doap_rng.rdf]

  $ (cd doap && svn commit -m "Commons RNG v1.5 was released (from RC1)")


(22)
In the git repository, put the official final tag to point at the same commit
as the **last release candidate** tag:

  $ git tag -v commons-rng-1.5-RC1

Check the commit hash then add the release tag.
Note: The 'rel/' prefix adds the tag to the release section of the tags.
This cannot be deleted once pushed to the main repository due to restrictions
on this section of the tag namespace (preventing deletion of official release
tags).

  $ git checkout 1.5-release
  $ git tag -u "__Your_key_id__" -s -m "RC1 becomes v1.5 official release." rel/commons-rng-1.5 [commit hash]
  $ git tag -v rel/commons-rng-1.5
  $ git log -1
  $ git push origin rel/commons-rng-1.5


(23)
Switch back to the "master" branch.
We now prepare for the next round of development (here we assume that the
next version will be 1.6).

  (23a)
  Retrieve files from the "1.5-release branch" (so that the web site will
  contain up-to-date information):

    $ git checkout 1.5-release commons-rng-client-api/src/site/site.xml \
                               commons-rng-core/src/site/site.xml \
                               commons-rng-simple/src/site/site.xml \
                               commons-rng-sampling/src/site/site.xml \
                               src/changes/changes.xml \
                               src/site/xdoc/download_rng.xml \
                               RELEASE-NOTES.txt \
                               src/site/resources/release-notes/RELEASE-NOTES-1.5.txt \
                               src/site/xdoc/release-history.xml

  Edit "src/changes/changes.xml" to add a new section for the next release,
  setting the release date and description to "TBD".
  Then commit them.

  (23b)
  Optional: If the release manager was changed retrieve the updated release manager details:

    $ git checkout 1.5-release dist-archive/pom.xml

  Edit every "pom.xml" file (i.e. for each module) to contain

    <version>1.6-SNAPSHOT</version>

  This can be done using maven:

    $ mvn release:update-versions -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -Prelease -Pexamples

  You will only be prompted for the desired version number once.
  This may miss the dist-archive/pom.xml for all
  the dependencies. This should be updated manually.
  Double-check that the "pom.xml" files *really* have a "-SNAPSHOT" suffix
  in the "<version>" property.

  $ git grep '1.5-SNAPSHOT'    [old version number]
  $ git grep '1.6-SNAPSHOT'    [new version number]
  $ git grep '<version>'

  Then commit them.

  (23c)
  Update the README.md files to refer the latest release. These files are
  auto-generated from the commons maven plugin using 'mvn common:readme-md'.
  The generated README.md files may have been edited for the multi-module
  set-up of RNG with extra text added to the main README.md.

  An updated will involve:

  1. Replacing the <version>1.4</version> example XML for the maven dependency to
     <version>1.5</version>.
  2. Updating any badges for Javadocs. This can be done using search and replace
     of '1.4.svg' for '1.5.svg' and '/1.4)' for '/1.5)'.

  Check the changes using 'git diff' and commit.

  (23d)
  Update the <commons.release.version> tag in the master pom for the next
  planned release.

  Update the <commons.bc.version> tag in the master pom for the recent release.

  (23e)
  Update any other files that use a hard-coded version number:

  - commons-rng-examples/examples-jpms/runApp.sh


(24)
Allow for the web site mirrors to be updated (possibly several hours); then
send (from your apache account) a release announcement to the following ML:
  announce@apache.org
  dev@commons.apache.org
  user@commons.apache.org

If you don't have it setup already you can follow these instructions to send
email from your apache account:

https://infra.apache.org/committer-email.html

The mail should be sent as text/plain. A text/html message will be refused by
the Apache mailer daemon.

You can use the following message as a template:

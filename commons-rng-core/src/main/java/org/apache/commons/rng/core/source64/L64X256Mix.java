/**
 * A 64-bit all purpose generator.
 *
 * <p>This is a member of the LXM family of generators: L=Linear congruential generator;
 * X=Xor based generator; and M=Mix. This member uses a 64-bit LCG and 256-bit Xor-based
 * generator. It is named as {@code "L64X256Mix"} in the {@code java.util.random}
 * package introduced in JDK 17; the LXM family is described in further detail in:
 *
 * <blockquote>Steele and Vigna (2021) LXM: better splittable pseudorandom number generators
 * (and almost as fast). Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages, Volume 5,
 * Article 148, pp 1â€“31.</blockquote>
 *
 * <p>Memory footprint is 384 bits and the period is (2<sup>256</sup> - 1) 2<sup>64</sup>.
 *
 * <p>This generator implements
 * {@link org.apache.commons.rng.LongJumpableUniformRandomProvider LongJumpableUniformRandomProvider}.
 * In addition instances created with a different additive parameter for the LCG are robust
 * against accidental correlation in a multi-threaded setting. The additive parameters must be
 * different in the most significant 63-bits.

     * The seed elements are used to set:</p>
     *
     * <ol>
     *   <li>The state of the generator
     *   <li>The state of the Weyl sequence
     *   <li>The increment of the Weyl sequence

     *
     * <p>The third element is set to odd to ensure a period of at least 2<sup>64</sup>. If the
     * increment is of low complexity then the Weyl sequence does not contribute high quality
     * randomness. It is recommended to use a permutation of 8 hex characters for the upper
     * and lower 32-bits of the increment.</p>
     *
     * <p>The state of the generator is squared during each cycle. There is a possibility that
     * different seeds can produce the same output, for example 0 and 2<sup>32</sup> produce
     * the same square. This can be avoided by using the high complexity Weyl increment for the
     * state seed element.</p>

     * @param seed Initial seed.
     * If the length is larger than 3, only the first 3 elements will
     * be used; if smaller, the remaining elements will be automatically set.

/**
 * This abstract class is a base for algorithms from the Permuted Congruential Generator (PCG)
 * family that use an internal 64-bit Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) and output 32-bits
 * per cycle.
 *
 * <h2>Note: PCG generators may exhibit massive stream correlation</h2>
 *
 * <p>Although the seed size is 128 bits, only the first 64 are effective: in effect,
 * two seeds that only differ by the last 64 bits may produce highly correlated sequences.
 *
 * <p>Due to the use of an underlying linear congruential generator (LCG) alterations
 * to the 128 bit seed have the following effect: the first 64-bits alter the
 * generator state; the second 64 bits, with the exception of the most significant bit,
 * which is discarded, choose between one of two alternative LCGs
 * where the output of the chosen LCG is the same sequence except for an additive
 * constant determined by the seed bits. The result is that seeds that differ
 * only in the last 64-bits will have a 50% chance of producing highly correlated
 * output sequences.

 * <p>Consider using the fixed increment variant where the 64-bit seed sets the
 * generator state.

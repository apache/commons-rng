This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits.

To generate the file RELEASE-NOTES.txt from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version]

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.

<!-- NOTE:
The description attribute entries below are specially formatted 
so as to improve the layout of the generated text release notes.

The parsing process removes all line feeds, replacing them with a single space.
The Velocity template in src/changes/release-notes.vm has been enhanced to replace pairs of adjacent spaces
with a new-line in the release notes. (These spaces are ignored when displaying HTML).
If the output is not quite correct, check for invisible trailing spaces!

    <release version="1.1" date="TBD" description="
This is a minor release of Apache Commons RNG, containing some
new features and performance improvements.

Apache Commons RNG 1.1 contains the following modules:
  commons-rng-client-api (requires Java 6)
  commons-rng-core (requires Java 6)
  commons-rng-simple (requires Java 6)
  commons-rng-sampling (requires Java 6)
  commons-rng-jmh (requires Java 6)
  commons-rng-examples (requires Java 7)
">
      <action dev="erans" type="add" issue="RNG-39">
        "UnitSphereSampler": generate random vectors isotropically located
        on the surface of a sphere (feature ported from "Commons Math").
      </action>
      <action dev="erans" type="add" issue="RNG-36">
        "MarsagliaNormalizedGaussianSampler": faster variation of the
        Box-Muller algorithm.
        This version is used within "AhrensDieterMarsagliaTsangGammaSampler"
        "MarsagliaLogNormalSampler" and "PoissonSampler" (generated sequences
        will thus differ from those generated by version 1.0 of the library).
      </action>
      <action dev="erans" type="add" issue="RNG-35">
        New generic "GaussianSampler" based on "NormalizedGaussianSampler"
        marker interface.
        Implementation of "BoxMullerNormalizedGaussianSampler" deprecates
        "BoxMullerGaussianSampler".

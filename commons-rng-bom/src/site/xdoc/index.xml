    <section name="Apache Commons RNG: Random Numbers Generators" href="summary">
      <p>
        Commons RNG provides implementations of pseudo-random numbers generators that are
        faster; of higher quality; and/or of a longer period than
        <code>java.util.Random</code> and <code>java.util.SplittableRandom</code>.
        Utilities are provided for sampling from distributions, collections and geometric shapes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Bill of Materials (BOM) is provided to aid in
        <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#bill-of-materials-bom-poms">dependency management</a>
        of the Apache Commons RNG modules.
      </p>

      <p>
        The BOM can be imported into a Maven pom to manage the module versions:

 * <p>This sampler is suitable for {@code mean < 40}. For large means,
 * {@link LargeMeanPoissonSampler} should be used instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: The algorithm uses a recurrence relation to compute the Poisson probability
 * and a rolling summation for the cumulative probability. When the mean is large the
 * initial probability (Math.exp(-mean)) is zero and an exception is raised by the
 * constructor.</p>
 *
 * <p>Sampling uses 1 call to {@link UniformRandomProvider#nextDouble()}. This method provides
 * an alternative to the {@link SmallMeanPoissonSampler} for slow generators of {@code double}.</p>

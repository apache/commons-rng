/**
 * Distribution sampler that uses the <a
 * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_method">Alias method</a>. It can be used to
 * sample from {@code n} values each with an associated probability. If all unique items
 * are assigned the same probability it is more efficient to use the {@link DiscreteUniformSampler}.
 *
 * <p>This implementation is based on the detailed explanation of the alias method by
 * Keith Schartz and implements Vose's algorithm.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>
 *   <blockquote>
 *    Vose, M.D.,
 *    <i>A linear algorithm for generating random numbers with a given distribution,</i>
 *     IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 17, 972-975, 1991.
 *   </blockquote>
 *  </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The algorithm will sample values in {@code O(1)} time after a pre-processing step of
 * {@code O(n)} time.</p>
 *
 * <p>The alias tables are constructed using fraction probabilities with an assumed denominator
 * of 2<sup>53</sup>. In the generic case sampling uses {@link UniformRandomProvider#nextInt(int)}
 * and the upper 53-bits from {@link UniformRandomProvider#nextLong()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Zero padding the input probabilities can be used to make more sampling more efficient.
 * Any zero entry will always be aliased removing the requirement to compute a {@code long}.
 * Increased sampling speed comes at the cost of increased storage space. The algorithm requires
 * approximately 12 bytes of storage per input probability, that is {@code n * 12} for size
 * {@code n}. Zero-padding only requires 4 bytes of storage per padded value as the probability is
 * known to be zero. A table can be padded to a power of 2 using the utility function
 * {@link #of(UniformRandomProvider, double[], int)} to construct the sampler.</p>
 *
 * <p>An optimisation is performed for small table sizes that are a power of 2. In this case the
 * sampling uses 1 or 2 calls from {@link UniformRandomProvider#nextInt()} to generate up to
 * 64-bits for creation of an 11-bit index and 53-bits for the {@code long}. This optimisation
 * requires a generator with a high cycle length for the lower order bits.</p>
 *
 * <p>Larger table sizes that are a power of 2 will benefit from fast algorithms for
 * {@link UniformRandomProvider#nextInt(int)} that exploit the power of 2.</p>

     * A random probability is compared to the value at this index: if lower then the sample is the
     * index; if higher then the sample uses the corresponding entry in the alias table.
     *
     * <p>This has entries up to the last non-zero element since there is no need to store
     * probabilities of zero. This is an optimisation for zero-padded input. Any zero value will
     * always be aliased so any look-up index outside this table always uses the alias.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that a uniform double in the range [0,1) can be generated using 53-bits from a long
     * to sample all the dyadic rationals with a denominator of 2<sup>53</sup>
     * (e.g. see org.apache.commons.rng.core.utils.NumberFactory.makeDouble(long)). To avoid
     * computation of a double and comparison to the probability as a double the probabilities are
     * stored as 53-bit longs to use integer arithmetic. This is the equivalent of storing the
     * numerator of a fraction with the denominator of 2<sup>53</sup>.</p>
     *
     * <p>During conversion of the probability to a double it is rounded up to the next integer
     * value. This ensures the functionality of comparing a uniform deviate distributed evenly on
     * the interval 1/2^53 to the unevenly distributed probability is equivalent, i.e. a uniform
     * deviate is either below the probability or above it:
     *
     * <pre>
     * Uniform deviate
     *  1/2^53    2/2^53    3/2^53    4/2^53

     *         rounded up
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Round-up ensures a non-zero probability is always non-zero and zero probability remains
     * zero. Thus any item with a non-zero input probability can always be sampled, and a zero
     * input probability cannot be sampled.</p>

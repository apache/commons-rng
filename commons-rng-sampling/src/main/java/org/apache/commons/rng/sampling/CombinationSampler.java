/**
 * Class for representing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination">combinations</a>
 * of a sequence of integers.
 *
 * <p>A combination is a selection of items from a collection, such that (unlike
 * permutations) the order of selection <strong>does not matter</strong>. This
 * sampler can be used to generate a combination in an unspecified order and is
 * faster than the corresponding {@link PermutationSampler}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the sample order is unspecified. For example a sample
 * combination of 2 from 4 may return {@code [0,1]} or {@code [1,0]} as the two are
 * equivalent, and the order of a given combination may change in subsequent samples.</p>
 *
 * <p>The sampler can be used to generate indices to select subsets where the
 * order of the subset is not important.</p>
 *
 * <p>Sampling uses {@link UniformRandomProvider#nextInt(int)}.</p>
